# Password generator

This is a password generator. It took me 2 days t make with my slow smoothbrain but, I did finish it!

## How 2 run

âžž To run the programme, go onto the file named "main.py" just right click and push "Run 'main'"

## How it works 

  ### Selection
âžž You get a selection of letters, digits and symbols and you decide whether to put what inside.

âžž Your selection then goes into a list with the options that you chose and area then shuffled into a list, the list being the amount of letters you would like.
  
  ### Amount
âžž At the start with the selection, you choose a amount of letters you would want to be put into you're password

âžž It then does the selection bit above with the amount of letters using a range loop

  ### End
âžž It then gets shuffled every single turn it adds a letter into the list

âžž Then, you get your password!!!
